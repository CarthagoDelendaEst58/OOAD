This is project 2 part 2, a simulaton of the FNMS. In the repo, the source code is listed, and can be ran within an InteliJ environment (or compiled separately, however 
InteliJ should be able to build as is if the source code is put under a /src directory. The output is an example output of 30 day simulation. The updated UML diagram is also
included.

The main changes in the UML diagram came from additional methods with each class. However, the relationship between objects and generally the classes needed stayed the same. The biggest class addition was a ItemFactory class, that allowed to more conveniently create instances of all of the different subtypes of Item. The FNMS class was also added, to incorporate initalize, simulate and summary, however the presence of such a class isn't surprising.

(NOTE: We emailed Professor Bruce to ask for an extension for this project early of last week, and he said that he could waive the late penalty for us.)
